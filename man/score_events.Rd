\title{Score behavioral patterns from external video recordings}
\usage{
score_events(
  duration = 15,
  save = TRUE,
  file = "score.events.txt",
  vect = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{duration}{numeric. Duration (in minutes) of the video recording for which to
score the behavior.}

\item{save}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, saves the results into a tab-delimited file.}

\item{file}{character. File name where to save the results.}

\item{vect}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, returns a binary vector of seconds when the
behavior was recorded.}
}
\value{
Returns data.frame with columns events (codes for recorded behaviors), 
        stroke.time (elapsed process time when the change in behavior was recorded), time.s 
        time.s (start of the behavior in seconds from the beginning of recording), and
        duration (duration of the behavior in seconds).

        If \code{vect = TRUE}, returns a binary vector for when the selected behavior
        was recorded.
}
\description{
Writes times when the user indicates a behavior started. Optionally converts the 
recorded times of the beginnings of specific behaviors to a vector, indicating in what
seconds the object performed a behavior.
}
\note{
Use \code{vect = TRUE} with \code{save = TRUE}, otherwise recordings of all other
      behaviors get lost.
